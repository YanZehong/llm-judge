The first cherry trees were planted in March 1912, when more than 3,000 trees were placed throughout the nation's capital as a gift to the US from the people of Japan. With pink blossoms in bloom along the Tidal Basin and throughout the National Mall, visitors are busy taking pictures and enjoying the colorful views. To celebrate the peak season, Washington DC also hosts the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival, which features a series of events and festivities centered around the cherry trees.

Sakharam Bhagat, 66, poses with his wives, Sakhri, Tuki and Bhaagi (L to R) inside their house in Denganmal village, Maharashtra, India, April 20, 2015. In Denganmal, a village in Maharashtra state, some men take a second or third wife just to make sure their households have enough drinking water. Becoming what are known as \"water wives\" allows the women, often widows or single mothers, to regain respect in conservative rural India by carrying water from the well quite some distance from the remote village. When the water wife, who does not usually share the marital bed, becomes too old to continue, the husband sometimes takes a third and younger spouse to fetch the water in metal pitchers or makeshift containers.
